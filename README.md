 Input Support: Built-in compatibility for mouse, keyboard, and controller navigation.

 Grid Canvas Toggle: Easily show/hide the grid to align your level design.

 Save Levels: Prompt to enter a name and save level data.

 Play Mode: Enter test mode to preview the level directly from the editor.

 Undo/Redo: Simple controls to backtrack or redo your changes.
